# empiricaldist

`empiricaldist` is a Python library that provides classes to represent empirical distributions -- that is, distributions based on data rather than mathematical functions.
It includes four equivalent ways to represent a distribution: PMF (Probability Mass Function), CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function), Survival function and Hazard Function.
It provides methods to convert from one representation to the others, and methods to perform a variety of operations.
