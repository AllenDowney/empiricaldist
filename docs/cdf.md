# Cumulative Distribution Function (Cdf)

A `Cdf` object represents a mapping from a quantity to the probability that a value from the distribution does not exceed the quantity.

`Cdf` is a subclass of a Pandas `Series`, so it has all `Series` methods, although some are overridden to change their behavior.
